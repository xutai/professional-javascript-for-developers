    <p>Perhaps the most important part of any JavaScript solution is the final deployment to the website or
        web application in production. You’ve done a lot of work before this point, architecting and optimizing
        a solution for general consumption. It’s time to move out of the development environment and
        into the web, where real users can interact with it. Before you do so, however, there are a number of
        issues that need to be addressed.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="build-process">build-process</h2>
    <p>One of the most important things you can do to ready JavaScript code for deployment is to develop
        some type of build process around it. The typical pattern for developing software is write-compiletest,
        in that you write the code, compile it, and then run it to ensure that it works. Because JavaScript
        is not a compiled language, the pattern often becomes write-test, where the code you write is the same
        code you test in the browser. The problem with this approach is that it’s not optimal; the code you
        write should not be passed, untouched, to the browser, for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Intellectual property issues—If you put the fully commented source code online, it’s easier
            for others to figure out what you’re doing, reuse it, and potentially figure out security holes.</li>
        <li>File size—You write code in a way that makes it easy to read, which is good for maintainability
            but bad for performance. The browser doesn’t benefit from the extra white space,
            indentation, or verbose function and variable names.</li>
        <li>Code organization—The way you organize code for maintainability isn’t necessarily the
            best way to deliver it to the browser.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>compiletest?? compile test</p>
    <p>untouched adj. 未受影响的；未改变的；未触动过的；不受感动的</p>
    <p>For these reasons, it’s best to define a build process for your JavaScript files.</p>
    <section>
        <h3 id="file-structure">file-structure</h3>
        <p>A build process starts by defining a logical structure for storing your files in source control. It’s best
            to avoid having a single file that contains all of your JavaScript. Instead, follow the pattern that
            is typically taken in object-oriented languages: separate each object or custom type into its own
            file. Doing so ensures that each file contains just the minimum amount of code, making it easier to
            make changes without introducing errors. Additionally, in environments that use concurrent source
            control systems such as Git, CVS, or Subversion, this reduces the risk of conflicts during merge
            operations.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that separating your code into multiple files is for maintainability and not for deployment.
            For deployment, you&rsquo;ll want to combine the source files into one or more rollup files. It&rsquo;s
            recommended
            that web applications use the smallest number of JavaScript files possible, because HTTP requests are
            some of the main performance bottlenecks on the web. Keep in mind that including a JavaScript file via
            a vanilla &lt;script&gt; tag is a blocking operation that stops all other downloads while the code is
            downloaded
            and executed. Therefore, try to logically group JavaScript code into deployment files.</p>

        <h3 id="task-runner">task-runner</h3>
        <p>If you’re putting together an application that’s anything more than a few files, you will likely
            find yourself reaching for a task runner to automate tasks for you. The task runner can perform
            jobs such as linting, bundling, transpilation, starting a local server, deployment, or any other
            scripted program.</p>
        <p>put together ..放在一起；组合；装配</p>
        <p class="question">transpilation</p>
        <p>Much of the time, jobs that your task runner will perform are available through command-line
            interfaces, and therefore your task runner will merely be a tool that aids in grouping and ordering
            complex command line invocations. In this sense, a task runner in many ways is very similar to a
            .bashrc file. In other cases, the tools you wish to use in automated tasks will have designated plugins
            compatible</p>
        <p>If you’re using NodeJS and npm to package your JavaScript assets, two popular task runners are
            Grunt (www.gruntjs.com) and Gulp (www.gulpjs.com). Both of these tools are robust task runners
            whose jobs and instructions are defined inside configuration files written in plain JavaScript.
            The benefit of using these task runners is that each enjoys an ecosystem of plugins, which allow
            the tools to directly interface with npm packages. Details of these plugins can be found in the
            appendixes.</p>

        <h3 id="tree-shaking">tree-shaking</h3>
        <p>An increasingly common and extremely effective strategy for reducing payload size is tree shaking. As
            mentioned in the Modules chapter, using a static module declaration style means that build tools can
            determine which parts of the codebase depend on other parts. More importantly, tree shaking is also
            capable of determining which parts of the codebase are not needed at all.</p>
        <p>Build tools that implement tree shaking acknowledge that module imports are frequently selective
            and that entire segments of module files can be ignored in the final bundled file. Suppose this is your
            example application:</p>
        <p>acknowledge vt. 承认；答谢；报偿；告知已收到</p>
        <pre><code>
import { foo } from './utils.js';

console.log(foo);
export const foo = 'foo';
export const bar = 'bar'; // unused
            </code></pre>
        <p class="question">
            what does this code mean?
            is the "foo" in "const foo" refers to the "foo" in "import { foo }"?
            // Uncaught SyntaxError: redeclaration of import foo
        <pre><code>
i guess the author might want to express this

// in utils.js
export const foo = 'foo';
export const bar = 'bar'; // unused

// other.js
import { foo } from './utils.js';
console.log(foo);
        </code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>Here, the bar export is never used, and static analysis by a build tool can easily determine this is the
            case. When performing tree shaking, the build tool will completely strip out the bar export from
            the bundled file. Static analysis also means that the build tool can determine dependencies that are
            unused and decline to include those as well. By performing tree shaking, the file size savings of the
            eventual bundle can be enormous.</p>

        <h3 id="module-bundlers">module-bundlers</h3>
        <p>Just because your codebase is written in modules doesn’t mean that it should necessarily be served
            as modules. Often, JavaScript codebases composed of a large collection of modules will be bundled
            together at build time and served as one or a few different JavaScript files.</p>
        <p>serve as 担任…，充当…；起…的作用</p>
        <p>The module bundler’s job is to identify the landscape of JavaScript dependencies involved in an application,
            combine them into a monolithic application, make informed decisions about how the modules
            should be serially organized and concatenated, and generate the output files that will be provided to
            the browser.</p>

        <p>serially adv. 连续地；连载地</p>
        <p>There is an abundance of build tooling that allows you to accomplish such a feat. Webpack, Rollup,
            and Browserify are just a few of the many options you have to convert a module-based codebase into
            a universally compatible page script.</p>

    <h2 id="validation">validation</h2>
    <p>Even though IDEs that understand and support JavaScript are starting to appear, most developers still
        check their syntax by running code in a browser. There are a couple of problems with this approach.
        First, this validation can’t be easily automated or ported from system to system. Second, aside from
        syntax errors, problems are encountered only when code is executed, leaving it possible for errors to
        occur. Several tools are available to help identify potential issues with JavaScript code, the most popular
        being Douglas Crockford’s JSLint (www.jslint.com) and ESLint (www.eslint.org).</p>
    <p>Linters look for syntax errors and common coding errors in JavaScript code. Some of the potential
        issues they surface are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use of eval()</li>
        <li>Use of undeclared variables</li>
        <li>Omission of semicolons</li>
        <li>Improper line breaks</li>
        <li>Incorrect comma usage</li>
        <li>Omission of braces around statements</li>
        <li>Omission of break in switch cases</li>
        <li>Variables being declared twice</li>
        <li>Use of with</li>
        <li>Incorrect use of equals (instead of double- or triple-equals)</li>
        <li>Unreachable code</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Adding code validation to your development cycle helps to avoid errors down the road. It’s recommended
        that developers add some type of code validation to the build process as a way of identifying
        potential issues before they become errors.</p>
    <p class="info">A list of JavaScript code validators can be found in Appendix D.</p>

    <h2 id="compression">compression</h2>
    <p>When talking about JavaScript file compression, you’re really talking about two things: code size and
        wire weight. Code size refers to the number of bytes that need to be parsed by the browser, and wire
        weight refers to the number of bytes that are actually transmitted from the server to the browser. In
        the early days of web development, these two numbers were almost always identical because source
        files were transmitted, unchanged, from server to client. In today’s web, however, the two are rarely
        equal and realistically should never be.</p>

    <section>
        <h3 id="code-minification">code-minification</h3>
        <p>minification n. 微小；缩小; minifier 缩小器</p>
        <p>Because JavaScript isn’t compiled into byte code and is transmitted as source code, the source code
            files usually contain additional information and formatting that have no effect on the browser’s
            JavaScript interpreter. A JavaScript minifier will perform transformations on your source code to
            make the file size as small as possible while retaining identical program flow.</p>
        <p>Comments, extra white space, and long variable or function names improve readability for developers
            but are unnecessary extra bytes when sent to the browser. A minifier can decrease the file size by
            performing the following duties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove extra white space (including line breaks)</li>
            <li>Remove all comments</li>
            <li>Shorten variable names, function names, and other identifiers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All JavaScript files should be minified with a minification tool before being deployed to a production
            environment. Adding a step in your build process to compress JavaScript files is an easy way to
            ensure that this always happens.</p>
        <div class="info">
            <p>In the context of web development, the term “minification” is often used
                interchangeably with “compression.” Doing so can be considered a minor faux
                pas, as the semantics of each have little overlap.</p>
            <p>faux pas 失言，失礼，失误</p>
            <p><small class="keyword">Minification</small> is a process where the minified file size is smaller than the
                original, but
                the minified file is still <small class="key">syntactically correct code</small>. Generally,
                minification is only
                useful for interpreted languages like JavaScript because languages that are formally
                compiled into a binary will be minified by the compiler as a matter of course.</p>
            <p>matter of course 理所当然的事</p>
            <p><small class="keyword">Compression</small> is distinct from minification in that a compressed file is
                also smaller
                than the original but is <small class="key">not syntactically correct code</small>. A compressed file
                must be
                uncompressed in order to regain the form of readable code. Compression will result
                in a smaller file size than minification, as compression algorithms do not have to preserve
                the syntactical structure of the file and therefore can take additional liberties.</p>

        <h3 id="javascript-compilation">javascript-compilation</h3>
        <p>Similar in spirit to minification, code compilation generally refers to the process of taking source code
            and converting it into a form that is behaviorally identical but uses fewer bytes of JavaScript. This is
            distinct from minification in that the post-compilation code structure may be different, but it will still
            exhibit the same behavior as your original source code. Compilers are able to do this by ingesting the
            entirety of your JavaScript code and performing robust analysis on program flow.</p>

        <h3 id="javascript-transpilation">javascript-transpilation</h3>
        <p>The code in your project repository will almost never be the exact code that will execute in your
            browser. ES6, ES7, and ES8 all introduce wonderful abilities into the ECMAScript specification, but
            different browsers will fully implement each of their features at different paces.</p>
        <p>Using transpilation will allow you to wield all the newest syntactical specification features without
            having to worry about backwards browser compatibility. You can transpile your modern code to an
            older ECMAScript version—typically ES3 or ES5, depending on your needs—so that your code can
            work everywhere. Transpilation tools are covered in the appendixes.</p>
        <p class="info">The terms "transpilation" and "compilation" are often used interchangeably.
            <dfn class="key">Compilation</dfn> is the process of converting source code written in one language into
            a different language. <dfn class="key">Transpilation</dfn> is essentially the same process as compilation,
            but the end language will have a similar level of abstraction as the original language.
            Therefore, converting ES6/7/8 code into ES3/5 is technically both compilation and
            transpilation, although transpilation is a more exact term to describe the process.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h3 id="http-compression">http-compression</h3>
        <p>Wire weight refers to the actual number of bytes sent from the server to the browser. The number of
            bytes doesn’t necessarily have to be the same as the code size, because of the compression capabilities
            of both the server and the browser. All of the five major web browsers—Internet Explorer/Edge,
            Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Opera—support client-side decompression of resources that they receive.
            The server is therefore able to compress JavaScript files using server-dependent capabilities. As part
            of the server response, a header is included indicating that the file has been compressed using a given
            format. The browser then looks at the header to determine that the file is compressed, and then
            decompresses it using the appropriate format. The result is that the amount of bytes transferred over
            the network is significantly less than the original code size.</p>
        <p>For example, using two modules available for the Apache web server (mod_gzip and mod_deflate)
            results in savings of around 70 percent of the original file size of JavaScript files. This is largely due
            to
            the fact that JavaScript files are plain text and can therefore be compressed very efficiently. Decreasing
            the wire weight of your files decreases the amount of time it takes to transmit to the browser.
            Keep in mind that there is a slight trade-off because the server must spend time compressing the files
            on each request, and the browser must take some time to decompress the files once they arrive. Generally
            speaking, however, the trade-off is well worth it.</p>
        <p class="info">
            Most web servers, both open source and commercial, have some HTTP
            compression capabilities. Please consult the documentation for your server to
            determine how to configure compression properly.
