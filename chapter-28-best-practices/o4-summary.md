As JavaScript development has matured, best practices have emerged. What once was considered a hobby is now a legitimate profession and, as such, has experienced the type of research into maintainability, performance, and deployment traditionally done for other programming languages.

Maintainability in JavaScript has to do partially with the following code conventions:

- Code conventions from other languages may be used to determine when to comment and how to indent, but JavaScript requires some special conventions to make up for the loosely typed nature of the language.
- Because JavaScript must coexist with HTML and CSS, itâ€™s also important to let each wholly define its purpose: JavaScript should define behavior, HTML should define content, and CSS should define appearance.
- Any mixing of these responsibilities can lead to difficult-to-debug errors and maintenance issues.

As the amount of JavaScript has increased in web applications, performance has become more important. Therefore, you should keep these things in mind:

- The amount of time it takes JavaScript to execute directly affects the overall performance of a web page, so its importance cannot be dismissed.
- A lot of the performance recommendations for C-based languages also apply to JavaScript relating to loop performance and using switch statements instead of if.
- Another important thing to remember is that DOM interactions are expensive, so you should limit the number of DOM operations.

The last step in the process is deployment. Here are some key points discussed in this chapter:

- To aid in deployment, you should set up a build process that combines JavaScript files into a small number of files (ideally just one).
- Having a build process also gives you the opportunity to automatically run additional processes and filters on the source code. You can, for example, run a JavaScript verifier to ensure that there are no syntax errors or potential issues with the code.
- A compressor can get your files as small as possible before deployment.
- Coupling that with HTTP compression ensures that the JavaScript files are as small as possible and will have the least possible impact on overall page performance.
